"""
This code takes in a name and up to 5 classes for a person and then sorts them based on both class and number
It works by assigning a value to each class based on if it's upper, middle, and lower, and where it is in the list
It consists primarily of loops that manipulate the strings in the list and eventually output a 2D array
That 2D array is then sorted through python's built-in sort function and a lambda key
Finally I output the sorted names
